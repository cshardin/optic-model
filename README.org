#+TITLE: optic-model
* Overview
optic-model is for modeling optical systems, with a focus on telescopes.

This is a personal project meant to satisfy curiosity and is still in
an early stage.  In particular, the "input" is changed by editing code,
and the output is cryptic.
 
Currently, it can model telescopes that are composed solely of reflective
and refractive elements described by quadric surfaces (which includes spherical, parabolic,
hyperbolic, and elliptical, in particular).  It has models of refractor, Newtonian,
classical Cassegrain, and Ritchey-Chr√©tien scopes.

The primary design goal is to help understand the various kinds of aberrations
that different designs have.  In particular, the model is non-physical in that
we pretend rays can pass through the secondary reflector on their way to the
primary reflector.

* Design
The design is very similar to a ray tracer, except that:
- We trace rays from the source to a sensor rather than casting rays from
 a point-like camera.
- Whereas a ray tracer has to worry about what object in the scene a particular
 ray intersects, we assume a prescribed order in which elements are reached (e.g.,
 primary reflector, secondary reflector, then sensor).
- The output is not an image of a scene.  Or, more properly, it's a lot like an image of
 a scene, except that the scene is just a few infinitely distant point sources.
- We care about certain things that a ray tracer doesn't care about, like the relative
 phase of the rays when they reach the sensor.
 
In addition to tracing races through the system, we can do additional analysis like
measuring focal length and field curvature.
